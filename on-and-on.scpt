			-- 214 is Almost the duration of Like A G6. We don't wanna get to the ~end~ cause Spotify might throw a "commercial" which throws Applescript into a tailspin. This could be overcome with some tricky code, aka nested "trys", but I found a hack which is to just ~quit~ Spotify and restart, as Spotify doesn't seem to throw commercials the first thing out of the gate. It's a bit unglamorous, though makes for a pretty small script. :/
